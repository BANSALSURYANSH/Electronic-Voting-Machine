Electronic Voting Machine Using Fingerprint Sensor On Arduino

This project report documents the development of an Arduino-based electronic 
voting machine (EVM) aimed at enhancing the accuracy, security, and efficiency 
of the voting process. By utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, the EVM 
facilitates a smooth voting experience through a clear interface, with an LCD 
display that provides voter instructions and buttons for candidate selection. Each 
vote is recorded in real time to ensure accuracy and prevent duplicate entries. The 
system operates on a simple yet robust logic that manages voter interaction, 
secure vote storage, and results display. Designed as a prototype for small-scale 
use, this EVM presents a cost-effective, user-friendly solution that can be 
expanded for broader applications. By demonstrating effective data handling and 
intuitive design, the project underscores the potential for low-cost electronic 
systems in transforming traditional voting practices into more modern, accessible 
formats.
